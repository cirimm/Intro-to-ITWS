This lab was a lot of fun. It was hard finding things in Atom format, as most things were available as RSS only. Additionally, many sites used Feedburner, 
and I was unable to figure out how to extract XML from it. In the end, however, I got some articles pasted into my rss and atom feeds. Uploading to the
project page was very quick and easy for me, as I spent time working with the css to make the site easy to update when I first created it.
