This quiz was a lot of fun. I had to think outside the box on a number of occasions, such as figuring out how to store login information between pages (I used cookies).
I did think some parts of the quiz were unecessary, such as part g, as I thought that proficiency was demonstrated in this regard in lab 9, and it didn't help to make the website
look better.
