In this lab, I applied my knowledge of JavaScript to make an interactive form that allowed a user to submit data, which then read off that data.
I wasn't sure if I was supposed to create variables for the data to be stored, as this wasn't at all mentioned in the instructions, so I left it out
to make sure I didn't lose points for unintentional code.
