Outline is located in the main directory and is titled "sitemap"

For this quiz, I made some small adjustments to the site. First, I moved the stylesheet outside of it's own css folder into the main resources
folder, as it was unable to access the images otherwise. I think this is the best solution, as there is only one css file anyway, so I don't need
to organize them. Second, I had to make two more pages, one for each lab on the website. I then changed the links around to accommodate this. Those are
the only changes I made in the site architecture.

The idea behind the UI of the site was to have a centrally-located floating section where all of the content would go, with a menu bar, title, and content.
The menu bar was originally a horizontal bar, but I thought that the vertical bar looked better, so I changed it to be vertical. I wanted the site to
look good, so I worked out a color pallette based around snow, and colored everything accordingly. The background and images on the site emphasize this.
For the text, I wanted a sharp look, so I went with Piazzolla from Google Fonts. For the projects page, I wanted to be able to easily add new projects and 
labs as I completed them, so I made sure to make a modular system that allows me to easily copy/paste the formatting to create new entries.
